    "# Which filter to select?\n",
    "\n",
    "Determining which filtering technique is best for your application depends on several factors related to your specific data and the goals of your analysis. Since you're dealing with strain gage data which likely includes noise due to long cables, the ideal filter would effectively reduce noise while preserving the true signal as much as possible. Here are some considerations for choosing the right filter:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nature of Noise:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the noise is uniformly distributed and high-frequency, a low-pass filter like a Gaussian or Butterworth filter might be more effective.\n",
    "If the noise includes outliers or spikes, a median filter can be more suitable as it is robust against such outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Signal Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "If preserving the sharpness of signal changes (like steps or edges) is crucial, a median filter or Savitzky-Golay filter could be more appropriate.\n",
    "For smoother transitions or if you're interested in trends rather than exact values, moving averages or exponential smoothing might be better.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computational Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Some filters (like Fourier or Wavelet transforms) are computationally more complex and may not be necessary for simpler applications.\n",
    "Filters like moving averages, exponential smoothing, or median filters are computationally simpler and easier to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analysis Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need a quick visualization to understand trends, simpler methods like moving averages could suffice.\n",
    "For more detailed analysis or if you're preparing the data for machine learning models, more sophisticated methods might be required.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trial and Error:\n",
    "\n",
    "Often the best approach is to try different filters and visually inspect the results to see which one best preserves the features of interest while reducing noise.\n",
    "Compare the filtered data with your domain knowledge and expectations about what the data should realistically look like."
